Challenge the budding architect in you to see if he is capable of crafting utmost beauty into a structure while conserving its ability to withstand thumps and shocks!</p>
			
			<h2>Electronics Design</h2>
			<p>A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away. Can you can achieve the highest level of optimization and make your circuit stand out from the others while performing the same function?</p>

			<h2>Aeromodeling</h2>
			<p>Do you have the brilliance to outsmart the Wright brothers of this era? This competition requires one to develop a glider that has no motors or power supply.

So come up with a raptor and discover the aero scientist within you.</p>
			
			<h2>Robo 1</h2>
			<p>Do you dare to test your robo hounds metal in this blood thirsty war of speed and accuracy? This line follower robot competition gives a challenge to the tech-savvy minds to create their own autonomous bots that can follow a prescribed path in the least possible time. Mind you, there will be complex spiral paths and the robos will scurry simultaneously with other legion bots in parallel paths. The photo finish endings will give you the adrenaline rush of your life!</p>

		<h2>Respect For Women</h2>
		<p>In a society that claims to be advancing rapidly on all counts right from planning missions to the Mars to the development of nuclear energy, incidents like brutal rapes, molestation of women bring us back to square one. Have we just progressed materially? Haven't we achieved anything morally? This is the time when we must make the people realize that a woman is not a toy but the mother of all the creations. It is with this goal in mind that we are organizing the marathon themed on 'Respect for Women'. Being on the highest level of intelligence it is our moral and humane responsibly to stand up for the causes of women and exhibit our whole-hearted support by participating in the marathon.</p>
